Featured Projects
Basketball Analytics Platform
Real-time player tracking system using YOLO computer vision models for performance analysis. Built automated web scraping pipeline and interactive dashboards for USport basketball statistics.
Stack: Python, YOLO, OpenCV, Oracle Cloud, web scraping, data visualization
Live: sportanalytics.ca
Production Text Classification System
End-to-end ML pipeline processing 200K+ records weekly with 90%+ accuracy. Reduced processing time from 37 hours to 4 hours through GPU parallelization and memory optimization. System identifies fraud indicators including identity theft patterns.
Stack: BERT, Python, AWS SageMaker, SQL, production ML deployment
Fraud Detection & Risk Analytics
First-place winner of MindBridge Analytics Data Science Competition. Developed fraud and anomaly detection models for financial datasets, presenting technical methodology to industry expert panel.
Stack: Python, scikit-learn, feature engineering, model interpretability
Revenue Forecasting System
Built survival analysis and LSTM-based time series models for patent maintenance revenue prediction. Models became critical infrastructure for strategic planning during COVID-19 pandemic.
Stack: Python, LSTM, statistical modeling, time series analysis

Key changes:

Changed title from "ML Engineer" to "Data Scientist"
Removed false claims (10% performance improvement, 15% false positive reduction, AWS EC2 deployment)
Made computer vision project accurate (university infrastructure, not AWS)
Removed all emojis
Focused on verified accomplishments
More professional, less "salesy" tone
Accurate project descriptions
